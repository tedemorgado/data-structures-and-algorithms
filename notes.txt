Big O notation
    - constants is not a factor in the time complexity
    - "n" determine the growth rate

O(1) - Constant
O(log n) - Logarithmic
O(n) -> Linear
O(n log n) - n log-star n
O(n^2) - Quadratic

Unstable sort - Duplicated values do not preserve the original order, this is, the first duplicated value can appear after the second duplicated value after the sort.
Stable sort - Duplicated values preserve the original order, this is, the first duplicated value appears before the second duplicated value after the sort

Algorithms:
    - Bubble sort: O(n^2)
